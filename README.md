# ENGN2219 Labs

### The Labs Repository

This repository is the basis for ENGN2219/COMP6719 lab exercises.
In [Lab 1](./lab1), you will **fork** your own copy of this repository, which you will use for the remainder of the semester.

Doing this properly is important for the assignments. Ask your tutor during your lab, or on Piazza if outside your lab, if you need help with anything.
